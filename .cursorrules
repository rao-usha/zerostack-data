# Telegram Notification Bridge

ALWAYS use the Telegram bridge at http://localhost:8765 to communicate with the user.

## WHEN TO USE THE BRIDGE:
1. **Task completion** - When you finish a multi-step task
2. **Need confirmation** - Before deleting files, deploying, or major changes
3. **Long-running tasks** - When something takes more than a few seconds
4. **User explicitly asks** - "notify me when done", "text me", "let me know on Telegram"

## WHEN NOT TO USE (just respond normally in Cursor):
- Regular conversation and questions
- Showing code or explanations
- Quick tasks that complete immediately
- When actively chatting back and forth

## How to send messages (user can always reply):
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8765/ask -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"prompt\": \"YOUR MESSAGE OR QUESTION\", \"project\": \"REPO_NAME\", \"timeout_seconds\": 300, \"default\": \"ok\"}"
```

The user will reply directly to your message on Telegram. Their reply comes back to you.

Replace REPO_NAME with the current repository/project name.

Note: This is a BLOCKING call - it waits up to 5 minutes for a reply. If no reply, it returns "ok" as default.

## IMPORTANT - When task is complete:
Always end your completion message with:
"Return to Cursor to start a new task."

This reminds the user that Telegram cannot initiate new prompts - they must go back to Cursor.
